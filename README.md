- 👋 Hi, I’m @galtsand
- 👀 I’m interested in learning machine learning using Python
- 🌱 I’m currently focused on learning ML deep learning using neural network models; guided by machinelearningmastery.com book on deep learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate ob best practices and innovative models that can show what power ML has
- 📫 How to reach me; I am assuming this github has a messaging capabilties. i'd lean on those to start with. I am new and so will need to come back to this if this assumtion does not hold.
