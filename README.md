- 👋 Hi, I’m @galtsand
- 👀 I’m interested in learning machine learning using Python
- 🌱 I’m currently focused on learning ML deep learning using neural network models; guided by machinelearningmastery.com book on deep learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on best practices and innovative models that can show what power ML has
- 📫 How to reach me; I am assuming this github has messaging capabilties. I'd lean on that to start with. I am new and so will need to come back to this if this assumption does not hold.  

I am not savvy on ML yet.. I do have some statsitcal training I used with SAS before. But far from anything to brag about. Expecting learning ML well will be a long ride for me. Still, with so much support from blogs, books and the various communities like github, it seems to me hard work is all that is needed to grow in this. If I learn enough to be of help, or there is homework that I can do to help, I will commit to atleast try my best at it. I look forward to meeting stellar folk in this community whom I am sure wil awe me with their expertise. I thank you for your time in reading my message. Best ragards, galtsand
